##What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?##
The git and GitHub concepts were relatively clear to me, I would rather say that I needed more practice to make the workflow a more natural habit. Now I still have to think about each step, which slows down the challenge.

##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?##
* I can do multiple commits locally before pushing any of those to the remote repository
* iTerm is graphically more helpful than Apple's own Terminal
* Time-boxing is essential: I should come straight to the point with the challenge and spend more structured time dividing the challenge in structured blocks of work, with a time-estimate for each component

##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?##
I was the only student in the challenge so my questions were directed to the guide.
* Best practices in naming branches
* Confirmation about the naming practices for Commit messages
* Minor clarifications about the challenge
* Why using "git fetch" + "git merge" separately instead of "git pull"
* Clarification on the GitHub workflow (see below)

##What still confuses you about git?##
The workflow of reviewing changes by peers or co-workers:
* How to invite a coworker to conduct a code-review
* Where in the flow to stop (prior to mergin code etc)
I finished the merge conflict on my own (I ran out of time with the guide). It took me some time to work through the realease of the conflict and I was confused more than once, especially in understanding where to resolve the conflict: Remote or locally.

##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?##
I was the only student attending this GPS session, so I took on both a driver and navigator role. This may have not worked as intended, but learned me a great deal about both roles. It may have also slowed me down a bit as I double checked the instructions while coding the challenge.
In general: At the beginning of the week I was a bit reluctant towards the whole pairing concept, but having done two pair challenges and one GPS challenge I see a lot of benefit in this way of working. It allows me to better graps concepts y seeing a peer doing the code or by mysef explaining out loud how to proceed (or vica versa). Next to that, I also catched up with some shortcuts or handy programs to use.
